# ViralFactory

A content co-creation system for entrepreneurs who have ideas and domain experience but don't produce content themselves. The person supplies **seeds** (spoken or typed ideas), **reactions** (taste), **direct edits** (when they choose to write), and **lived material**; the system does the making — drafting in the person's real voice, publishing, measuring, researching what goes viral in their domain, and proposing its own improvements. Every improvement passes a human gate.

**StackPenni** (Caribbean AI + wealth brand) is user #1. The system is generic: **the harness is code, the business lives entirely in config and modules.** A second business onboards with zero code changes.

> **This is a living repository.** Docs are the source of truth, not an afterthought. If you change the pipeline, update the docs in the same session. If you changed the pipeline but did not update this doc, that is a bug.
>
> **If you made a decision and it's not in `CHANGELOG.md`, that is a bug.**

## Start here, by role

| You are | Read, in order |
|---|---|
| **Builder agent (Hermes)** | 1. `docs/CONTEXT.md` (the domain + decisions) → 2. `docs/CHARTER-v3.7.md` (the constitution) → 3. `BUILD_PLAN.md` (your tasks, guardrails) → 4. `playbooks/` (the procedures you implement). Then work `BUILD_PLAN.md` top-down, one task at a time. |
| **Architect / reviewer (Claude)** | `docs/CONTEXT.md` → `docs/CHARTER-v3.7.md` → `docs/decisions/DIVERGENCE-001-charter-amendments.md` → `docs/PROGRESS.md` → latest `review-wN` tag diff → write `docs/reviews/review-wN.md`. Incorporate approved divergences through a versioned charter amendment. |
| **Operator (human)** | `docs/CONTEXT.md` (what we're building and why) → `docs/INTAKE-USER1.md` (what materials you need to provide). You direct in plain language, react to drafts, and approve at gates. You never write code. |
| **New contributor / other AI** | `docs/CONTEXT.md`, then this README's repo map. |

                                  validator, provenance, jobs)
tests/                           ← keep green; every task lands with a test
```

## Ground rules (full list in BUILD_PLAN.md — these are the ones that get broken)

1. **Nothing business-specific in code.** Brand names, topics, feeds, queries, taxonomies, model names → `config/`. If a string describes the business, it is config.
2. **No judgment in code.** Understanding-tasks (tagging, titling, voice analysis, quality) = prompt template + JSON schema + validator. Never keyword heuristics.
3. **AI proposes, human gates — everywhere.** Modules are never edited silently. No gate, no write.
4. **If an AI does something clever once, it becomes a playbook.** Ad-hoc judgment that isn't captured is a defect.
5. **No patch scripts.** Wrong output → fix the prompt, config, or validator, versioned. Never a one-off fix.
6. **Per-piece approval is non-negotiable.** No auto-publish, ever.
7. **Direct edits are authoritative.** Human text overrides AI draft.
8. **Gate is async.** Queue, not a scheduled sitting.

## Workflow

Builder works `BUILD_PLAN.md` top-down → commit per task (task ID in message) → append to `docs/PROGRESS.md` → log every decision to `CHANGELOG.md` → blocked? open a GitHub issue, move on → every ~7 days tag `review-wN` → operator shares repo with Claude → corrections arrive as `docs/reviews/review-wN.md` → builder applies them before new milestone work.

## Status

Charter is at v3.7. AMENDMENT-010 ratifies the Visual + Soundtrack Pipeline and adds M13 (VF-VS-101..703). The next work is Phase M13-A: reconcile the operator-facing routes with the autonomous chain so both call the same production services before any new visual or soundtrack contracts are built. Existing deferred audio/voice tasks and operator checkpoints remain open as recorded in `BUILD_PLAN.md` and `docs/PROGRESS.md`.

## Original architect docs (preserved for reference)

The following files were written by Claude (architect) before the grill session. They contain the original Charter v3 design. The grill session identified 5 divergences (see `docs/decisions/DIVERGENCE-001-charter-amendments.md`), which are incorporated into `docs/CONTEXT.md` and `BUILD_PLAN.md`. The originals are preserved for audit trail:

- `StackPenni-Build-Charter-v3_2.md` — original charter (superseded by v3.3 → v3.4)
- `playbook-voice-profile-builder.md` — Voice Profile playbook (to be moved to `playbooks/`)
- `playbooks-remaining-seven.md` — remaining 7 playbooks (to be split into `playbooks/`)
- `UI-DIRECTION.md` — UI direction (laptop-first amendment in DIVERGENCE-001)
